# Gurman Pannu
**Aspiring Software Engineer — Systems-aware, pragmatic, and focused on shipping reliable small projects.**

This repository is the source for my portfolio site (https://gurmanpannu.dev). It reflects how I approach building and deploying simple, maintainable software.

## What I focus on
- Shipping end-to-end: small front ends, simple APIs, and deployable containers.
- Using proven tools: Node/Express, HTML/CSS/JS, Docker, Cloud Run.
- Keeping things understandable: clear structure, minimal dependencies, documented flows.

## Highlights from this repo
- Single-service Node/Express app serving static pages.
- Contact form wired to SMTP (shows I can integrate basic backend features).
- Production-minded artifacts: Dockerfile, health check, and clear structure per page.
- Per-page folders (`public/home`, `projects`, `experience`, etc.) to keep content modular.

## Deployed home
The live site is at https://gurmanpannu.dev, served via Google Cloud Run behind a custom domain.

## If you’re reviewing my work
- Browse the `public/` folders to see the static pages and styling choices.
- Check `src/` for how I separate config, routes, and a small mailer.
- See `public/assets/common` for shared styling and nav behavior.

Thanks for taking a look!
